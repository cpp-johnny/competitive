# Competitive Programming

All my solutions to aoc, codeforces, cses and project euler. I will try my best to attempt it all in C++

At the beginning of each directory there will be a file tittled `0thinkingProcess.md` which documments my thinking process and planning when doing the questions. 

If you find any errors or would like to suggest more efficient/better solutions feel free to do a pull request!
