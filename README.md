# Competitive Programming

All my solutions to codeforces, codebreakerxyz, kattis, cses and project euler. I will try my best to attempt it all in C++

At the beginning of each directory there will be a markdown file tittled `0thinkingProcess.md` which documments my thinking process and planning/learning points when doing the questions. 

If you find any errors or would like to suggest more efficient/better solutions, feel free to make a pull request!
